You always wanna' be the best (best best best best)
It's a struggle without an end
Running as fast as you can
But you will never reach your goal
It's the struggle of our daily life (life life life life)
Of politics and war...
Everyone here runs so fast
But never sees the finish
And suddenly you find yourself
Running with the Red Queen
Through valleys and over hills
And sometimes against the stream
And suddenly you realize
Nothing here is what it seems
You are beyond the looking glass
Like Alice and the Red Queen

And when you wonder why (why why why why)
You cannot get to this point
Cannot finish what you started
Then you are through the looking glass
And suddenly you find yourself
Running with the Red Queen
Through valleys and over hills
And sometimes against the stream
And suddenly you realize
Nothing here is what it seems
You are beyond the looking glass
Like Alice and the Red Queen

You're far beyond reality (reality reality reality reality)
Or isn't this the real world?
Where we all stuggle and fight (fight fight fight fight)
Without knowing what it's all for

And suddenly you find yourself
Running with the Red Queen (Running with the Red Queen)
Through valleys and over hills (And...)
And sometimes against the stream (Hey...)
And suddenly you realize (You realize)
Nothing here is what it seems (Nothing here is what it seems)
You are beyond the looking glass
Like Alice and the Red Queen (Like Alice and the Red Queen)

Like Alice and the Red Queen
You are beyond the looking glass
Like Alice and the Red Queen
