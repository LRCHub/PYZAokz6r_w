Vicious like a cageling
Tame like a wolf
On the hunt for a plaything
Got a taste for blood
Hunter to the core
Gotta sharpen her claws
In the dark stalks a cheshire grin
With a taste for blood

Pushing through these walls
It knows what it wants
And it won't be your slave forever

High like an angel
Devil in her wings
Divine while you're faithful
Flesh for the machine
Hunter to the core
Gotta sharpen her claws
In the dark stalks a cheshire grin
With a taste for blood

Pushing through these walls
It knows what it wants
And it won't be your slave forever

Pushing through these walls
It knows what it wants
And it won't be your slave forever

She's got a taste for blood
Already got prey on the run

She's got a taste for blood
Already got prey on the run

Pushing through these walls
It knows what it wants
And it won't be your slave forever

Pushing through these walls
It knows what it wants
And it won't be your slave forever
